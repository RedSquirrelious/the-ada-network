Hi all!

Congrats on graduating the classroom portion and starting your internships! All us Ada Alums are so excited for you as you move on to the next portion of your Ada adventure and head into internships. We'd like to invite you to join the Ada Alumna slack channel*--it's a place where we discuss code, Ada, Seattle events, talk about jobs, and share experiences from our workplaces. 

You'll be auto added to #general, but please add yourself to any other channel you are interested in. Additionally, not everyone knows everyone already! Please fill out your full name in your profile and add a photo of your face (if you feel comfortable) to help those who may not know you already. Bonus points for introducing yourself in #general; we'd love to know where you are interning! 

Expect an email from slack shortly with a link to sign up. If you don't get the email or want to be added through a different email address, just reply to this email and let me know. You do not have to feel obligated to join, but we'd love to have your presence and we share a lot of valuable resources. Please join us in growing and continuing our community!

Shoot me any questions you may have & hope to see you in there!
Liz
