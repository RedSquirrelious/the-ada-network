Hi C3!

All us Ada Alums are so excited for you as you move on to the next portion of your Ada adventure and head into internships. We'd like to invite you all to join the Ada Alum* slack channel--it's a place where we discuss code, Ada, Seattle events, talk about jobs, and share experiences from our workplaces. Each cohort so far has also created a private cohort channel so that we may talk amongst ourselves (e.g., we have a cohort[0] & cohort[1] channels).

Expect an email from slack shortly with a link to sign up. You do not have to feel obligated to join, but we'd love to have your presence and we share a lot of valuable resources. Please join us in growing and continuing our community!

Shoot me any questions you may have & hope to see you in there!
Liz

*Important note: The slack channel is hosted by cohort[0], I am the admin, and we have no official ties to the Ada organization. This slack channel is an informal & unofficial community of Ada classroom graduates started by my cohort. No one from the official Ada organization has access to the slack or involvement in the slack community.
