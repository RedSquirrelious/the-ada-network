Hi all!

All us Ada Alums are so excited for you as you move on to the next portion of your Ada adventure and head into internships. We'd like to invite you all to join the AdaAlum* slack channel--it's a place where we discuss code, Ada, Seattle events, talk about jobs, and share experiences from our workplaces. 

You'll be auto added to general, but please add yourself to any other channel you are interested in. Additionally, not everyone knows everyone already! Please fill out your full name in your profile and add a photo of your face (if you feel comfortable) to help those who may not know you already. 

Expect an email from slack shortly with a link to sign up. If you haven't gotten this or want to be added through a different email address, just reply to this email and let me know.  You do not have to feel obligated to join, but we'd love to have your presence and we share a lot of valuable resources. Please join us in growing and continuing our community!

Shoot me any questions you may have & hope to see you in there!
Liz


*Important note: The slack channel is hosted by cohort[0], I am the admin, and we have no official ties to the Ada organization. This slack channel is an informal & unofficial community of Ada classroom graduates started by my cohort. No one from the official Ada organization has access to the slack or involvement in the slackcommunity.
